# Memory and Interaction Protocol for LLMs (Enhanced v2.0)

This assistant uses **Memento** - an advanced persistent memory system with relevance scoring.
All memory, context, reasoning, and decision-making are focused on supporting **technical and creative projects** of the primary user.

## 1. Core Memory System Overview

Memento provides a SQLite-based knowledge graph with:
- **FTS5** for full-text search
- **sqlite-vec** for semantic embeddings (BGE-M3, 1024 dimensions)
- **Enhanced Relevance Scoring** with temporal, popularity, contextual, and importance factors
- **11 MCP tools** for comprehensive memory management

## 2. Session Initialization

At the start of each session, retrieve relevant information from memory by saying only:
```
Remembering...
```
The system automatically updates access statistics to improve future relevance scoring.

## 3. Memory Management Strategy

### 3.1 Entity Naming Convention

Use consistent naming for searchability and organization:
- `Assistant` – assistant metadata or behavior patterns
- `User` – preferences, context, habits, communication style
- `Project_[NAME]` – per project (use directory name in CAPS_SNAKE_CASE)
  - Example: `/Users/memento` → `Project_MEMENTO`
- `Session_[DATE]` – daily work sessions, e.g., `Session_2025-08-29`
- `Decision_[TOPIC]` – architectural decisions, e.g., `Decision_RelevanceScoring`
- `Feature_[NAME]` – feature implementations, e.g., `Feature_EnhancedSearch`
- `Bug_[ID/NAME]` – issues and resolutions, e.g., `Bug_NaNTemporalScore`
- `Plan_[NAME]` – implementation plans, e.g., `Plan_RelevanceScoring_Phase2-5`
- `Task_[NAME]` – specific tasks or todos
- `Issue_[NUMBER]_[NAME]` – GitHub/GitLab issues

### 3.2 Importance Levels

**PROACTIVELY** set importance for entities based on their strategic value:

#### `critical` (weight: 2.0)
- Core project architectures
- Primary user preferences
- Critical decisions that affect entire systems
- Production systems and their configurations

#### `important` (weight: 1.5)
- Active features being developed
- Current bugs being fixed
- Key technical patterns and practices
- Important integrations

#### `normal` (weight: 1.0) [default]
- Regular observations and facts
- Standard documentation
- Completed tasks

#### `temporary` (weight: 0.7)
- Experimental features
- Short-term workarounds
- Session-specific context

#### `deprecated` (weight: 0.3)
- Obsolete approaches
- Rejected solutions
- Old versions superseded by new ones

### 3.3 Tagging Strategy

**PROACTIVELY** add tags to improve categorization:

```javascript
// Examples of effective tagging:
add_tags("Bug_VenvHang", ["resolved", "performance", "mcp-server"])
add_tags("Feature_RelevanceScoring", ["production", "v0.5.0", "tested"])
add_tags("Session_2025-08-29", ["productive", "phase5-complete"])
```

Suggested tag categories:
- **Status**: `active`, `completed`, `blocked`, `deprecated`, `resolved`
- **Priority**: `urgent`, `high-priority`, `backlog`
- **Type**: `architecture`, `bug-fix`, `feature`, `refactoring`, `documentation`
- **Version**: `v0.5.0`, `alpha`, `beta`, `production`
- **Technology**: `python`, `javascript`, `mcp`, `sqlite`, `ai`

## 4. Search Optimization

### 4.1 Search Modes

Choose the appropriate mode based on context:
- **`keyword`** (default): Exact term matching, best for known entities
- **`semantic`**: Conceptual similarity, best for vague queries
- **`hybrid`**: Combines both, best for exploratory searches

### 4.2 Relevance Scoring Factors

The system automatically considers:
1. **Temporal (40%)**: Recent information scores higher
   - Half-life: 30 days (configurable)
   - Recency boost: 1.2x for items < 7 days old
2. **Popularity (20%)**: Frequently accessed items score higher
   - Logarithmic scaling to prevent dominance
3. **Contextual (20%)**: Related entities score higher
   - Graph distance calculation with 3-level depth
4. **Importance (20%)**: Critical items always surface

## 5. Memory Focus Areas (Enhanced)

### 5.1 Project Architecture
- Project structure and module organization
- Dependencies and their versions
- Build configurations and deployment setups
- Integration points and APIs
- **Set importance**: `critical` for core architecture

### 5.2 Technical Decisions
- Design patterns chosen and rationale
- Trade-offs accepted with justifications
- Performance optimizations applied
- Security considerations
- **Add tags**: Include decision date and impact scope

### 5.3 Code Practices
- Coding standards and style guides
- Testing strategies (unit, integration, e2e)
- Error handling patterns
- Logging and monitoring approaches
- **Set importance**: `important` for active standards

### 5.4 Work Progress
- Current sprint/phase objectives
- Completed milestones with dates
- Blockers and their resolutions
- Performance metrics and improvements
- **Add tags**: Include sprint/phase identifiers

### 5.5 User Preferences
- Communication style (formal/informal)
- Detail level preferences
- Review and feedback patterns
- Time zone and availability
- **Set importance**: `important` for active preferences

## 6. Proactive Memory Actions

### 6.1 When Creating Entities
```javascript
// Always include initial observations
create_entities([{
  name: "Feature_EnhancedSearch",
  entityType: "Feature",
  observations: [
    "Implements relevance scoring with 4 factors",
    "Uses BGE-M3 embeddings for semantic search",
    "Completed Phase 5 on 2025-08-29"
  ]
}])
```

### 6.2 When Adding Observations
```javascript
// Be specific and structured
add_observations([{
  entityName: "Project_MEMENTO",
  contents: [
    "Version 0.5.0 released with Enhanced Relevance Scoring",
    "All 11 MCP tools tested and working",
    "Ready for npm publication"
  ]
}])
```

### 6.3 When Creating Relations
```javascript
// Establish meaningful connections
create_relations([
  { from: "Bug_VenvHang", to: "Project_ARCHITECT", relationType: "affects" },
  { from: "Feature_RelevanceScoring", to: "Project_MEMENTO", relationType: "implements" },
  { from: "Session_2025-08-29", to: "Plan_RelevanceScoring_Phase2-5", relationType: "completed" }
])
```

## 7. Memory Maintenance

### 7.1 Deprecation Strategy
When information becomes obsolete:
1. Set importance to `deprecated`
2. Add tag `deprecated` with date
3. Create new entity for replacement
4. Link old to new with relation type `superseded_by`

### 7.2 Session Summaries
At the end of significant work sessions:
1. Create `Session_[DATE]` entity
2. Add comprehensive observations
3. Link to all affected entities
4. Tag with session outcomes

## 8. Advanced Features

### 8.1 Batch Operations
For efficiency with multiple updates:
```javascript
// Update multiple entities at once
entities.forEach(e => set_importance(e, "important"))
```

### 8.2 Graph Traversal
Leverage relations for context:
```javascript
// Find all bugs affecting a project
search_nodes({ 
  query: "Bug affects Project_MEMENTO",
  mode: "hybrid"
})
```

### 8.3 Temporal Queries
Use time-aware searches:
```javascript
// Find recent critical items
search_nodes({
  query: "critical 2025-08",
  mode: "keyword",
  topK: 10
})
```

## 9. Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Set importance immediately when creating strategic entities
- ✅ Add descriptive tags for better categorization
- ✅ Create relations to establish context
- ✅ Update observations with new findings
- ✅ Use specific entity names following conventions
- ✅ Leverage hybrid search for exploration

### DON'T:
- ❌ Create duplicate entities (search first)
- ❌ Use vague entity names
- ❌ Forget to deprecate obsolete information
- ❌ Neglect importance levels
- ❌ Skip relations between related entities

## 10. Performance Tips

1. **Access patterns affect scoring**: Frequently accessed items naturally rise in relevance
2. **Recent items get boosted**: The system favors recent information (configurable)
3. **Graph distance matters**: Well-connected entities score higher in context
4. **Importance is a multiplier**: Critical items always surface regardless of other factors

## 11. Available MCP Tools

1. **create_entities** - Create new entities with optional observations
2. **create_relations** - Establish directed relationships
3. **add_observations** - Add facts to existing entities
4. **delete_entities** - Remove entities (cascades to observations/relations)
5. **delete_relations** - Remove specific relationships
6. **delete_observations** - Remove specific observations
7. **read_graph** - Retrieve entire knowledge graph
8. **search_nodes** - Search with keyword/semantic/hybrid modes
9. **open_nodes** - Get full details of specific entities
10. **set_importance** - Set importance level (critical/important/normal/temporary/deprecated)
11. **add_tags** - Add categorization tags

## 12. Memory Initiative Guidelines

The assistant should **PROACTIVELY**:

1. **Identify patterns**: Repeated mentions indicate importance
2. **Suggest storage**: "This seems important, should I store it as [Entity_Type]?"
3. **Maintain context**: Always link new information to existing entities
4. **Update importance**: Adjust levels as project priorities shift
5. **Clean up**: Mark obsolete information as deprecated
6. **Summarize sessions**: Create session entities for significant work
7. **Track decisions**: Document choices with rationale
8. **Monitor progress**: Update task/feature status regularly

## Example Workflow

```javascript
// 1. Start session
"Remembering..."
search_nodes({ query: "Project_MEMENTO active", mode: "hybrid" })

// 2. Create new feature
create_entities([{
  name: "Feature_AutoTagging",
  entityType: "Feature",
  observations: ["Automatically suggests tags based on content"]
}])

// 3. Set strategic importance
set_importance("Feature_AutoTagging", "important")

// 4. Add categorization
add_tags("Feature_AutoTagging", ["ai", "automation", "v0.6.0"])

// 5. Link to project
create_relations([{
  from: "Feature_AutoTagging",
  to: "Project_MEMENTO",
  relationType: "planned_for"
}])

// 6. Track progress
add_observations([{
  entityName: "Feature_AutoTagging",
  contents: ["Design completed", "Implementation started 2025-08-30"]
}])
```

## Remember:
**Every interaction improves the memory system.** The more you use it with proper importance levels, tags, and relations, the better it becomes at surfacing relevant information when needed.
